This folder is used to organize event images for the website gallery.

Directory Structure:

How to Add Images:
-----------------
1. Choose the appropriate category folder based on the event type
2. Upload your images to that folder
3. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., "rustic-wedding-setup.jpg")
4. Optimize images for web display (recommended size: 1200x800 pixels)
5. Use JPG, PNG, or GIF formats

The gallery page will automatically load all images from these folders and display them in the respective categories.

Notes:
-----
- Images will appear in alphabetical order by filename
- To feature special images at the top, prefix with numbers (e.g., "01-featured-wedding.jpg")
- The image filename will be converted to a title on the gallery page
  Example: "rustic-wedding-setup.jpg" will display as "Rustic wedding setup"
